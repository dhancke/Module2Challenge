'Assignment:
'Create a script that loops through all of the stock for 1 year and outputs the following:

    'A The ticker symbol
    'B Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price of the end of that year
    'C The % change from the opening price at the beginning of thea give year to the closing price at the end of that year
    'D The total stock volume of stock
    'E Conditional Formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative in red
